# CO2 Emission by Cars
A reliable End to End Machine Learning Model to predict CO2 Emissions in different type of Cars. 

### Description

Task is build a machine learning model to predict CO2 emissions by different types of cars based on features such as:

* Model of car
* Engine Size (in Litre)
* Number of cylinders
* Class of vehicle
* Fuel consumption (on highways, in city roads)

Project also aims at testing the influence of different independent features on the emission of CO2 using statistal methods.

### DataSet:

* The dataset has been taken from Canada Government official open data website and available at [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/debajyotipodder/co2-emission-by-vehicles)
* Cleaned and processed version of the data can be accessed from here [Link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d0r1h/CO2-Emission-by-Cars/main/final_co2.csv)
* Dataset contains 7385 datapoints and 12 columns.


### Notebook:

Notebook contains the EDA, data processing, and model building ideas.

### Models
We experimented different methods for model building 

* OLS Regression
* Ridge Regression
* Lasso Regression	
* Elastic Net Regression

### Techstack

**Python version** : 3.7 <br>
**Packages**: pandas, numpy, seaborn, sklearn, mlxtend, statsmodels, mlxtend<br>
**Cloud**: heroku

### Usage [running locally]:

```python
conda create -n envname python=3.7
activate envname
git clone https://github.com/d0r1h/CO2-Emission-by-Cars.git
cd CO2-Emission-by-Cars
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

## Results 


* Ridge Regression (with alpha = 0.5) has been the most effective in reducing RMSE.
* The exact combination of features responsible for high CO2 emissions cannot be predicted Since all the features are highly correlated.
* Following image shows score table for different models
